# 💰 TheMoneyShot — POS System

> *From the makers of **SwiftGrade** — the Flutter-powered Capstone beast that scans answer sheets like a Zipgrade on steroids (OMR), reads handwritten short answers with OCR + NLP, and turns classrooms into game shows with Kahoot/Quizizz/Mentimeter-style interactivity.*
>
> *We present to you... a system that handles transactions so smooth, so satisfying, so precise — you'll want to do it again. And again. And maybe one more time just to be sure.*
>
> ***TheMoneyShot.** Every sale. Right on target. Every. Single. Time.*

A dangerously attractive, multi-branch Point of Sale system built with **Flask**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Flowbite**. Dark-mode glassmorphism UI that'll make your registers blush.

**Version:** Alpha 2.1.6 / Beta 1.0 — *Bottoms Up (Desktop Shell & Aesthetic Persistence)*

## ✨ Features — What Can She Do?

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Theme Engine (Live)** | Instantly flip between Dawn (Light), Dusk (Dark), and Midnight (AMOLED) states. No reload needed. Smooth. |
| **Aesthetic Memory** | Dawn/Dusk/Midnight themes now persist via cookies, adapting the UI before you even log in. |
| **Role Aesthetic System** | The environment dynamically shifts colors based on your vibe: Admin/Rose, Cashier/Turquoise, Auditor/Amber. |
| **Desktop Shell** | Native Windows wrapper via Electron. Custom draggable regions, safe margins, and crisp frameless borders. |
| **Shift Management** | Strict Starting/Ending Cash declarations. 10-second countdowns on open, X-Report partials on close. |
| **Cash Vaulting (Safe Word)** | Real physical cash tracking. Withdrawals on shift open, Safe Drops on shift close, hard POS lockouts. |
| **Periodic Audits (The Climax)**| Aggregate Sales, Voids, Loans, and Low-Stock warnings over Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Annual horizons. |
| **Audit Logs** | Rigorous tracking of stock adjustments and void transactions. Zero blindspots, zero trust. |
| **Branch Management** | Multi-branch support with per-branch stock tracking. She gets around — professionally. |
| **Void System** | Void individual items or entire orders securely from the admin/manager dashboard. Fully logged. |
| **Loan / Credit** | Customer credit tracking with payment processing. We keep tabs on who owes us one. |
| **Reports & Dashboards** | Live stats, Vault balances, active ledgers, and the dedicated Auditor Command Center. |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack — What's Under the Hood

No need to undress the architecture yourself — here's the full reveal:

- **Backend:** Python 3 · Flask · SQLAlchemy · Flask-Login · Flask-Migrate
- **Frontend:** Jinja2 · Tailwind CSS (local build) · Flowbite · ApexCharts
- **Desktop Wrapper:** ElectronJS · Native Preload APIs
- **Database:** SQLite (dev) — PostgreSQL-ready (prod)

> Built tight, runs smooth, handles heavy loads, and now sits comfortably on your desktop.

## 🚀 Quick Start — Getting It Up and Running

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo (take her home)
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/TheMoneyShot.git
cd TheMoneyShot

# 2. Create virtual environment (protection first)
python -m venv venv

# 3. Activate (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# or macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

# 4. Install Python dependencies (foreplay)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Install frontend dependencies & build CSS (dress her up)
npm install
npm run build:css

# 6. Seed the database (plant the seed)
python seed.py

# 7. Run the desktop app! (Let her ride)
npm run electron:dev
```

*(Note: The Electron wrapper will automatically spawn the Flask server on http://127.0.0.1:5000 in the background for you.)*

## 🔑 Default Accounts — Who's in the Backdoor?

| Username | Password | Role | Branch |
|----------|----------|------|--------|
| `admin` | `admin123` | Admin | Main Branch |
| `manager` | `manager123` | Manager | Main Branch |
| `auditor` | `audit123` | Accounting | Main Branch |
| `cashier1` | `cashier123` | Cashier | Main Branch |
| `cashier2` | `cashier123` | Cashier | Uptown Branch |

> ⚠️ **Change these immediately in production.** Leaving defaults on is like leaving the door wide open — and not in the fun way.
